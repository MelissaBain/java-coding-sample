Samples of java code from my time at Sandia National Labs

This code implements an alternative to DBSCAN based on the paper "Finding Clusters of Different Sizes, Shapes, and Densities in Noisy, High Dimensional Data" (https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/papers/SIAM_snn.pdf).

I coded this during a summer internship in 2017, and has since been incorporated into the Cognitive Foundry, an open source ML library: https://github.com/algorithmfoundry/Foundry/blob/dbscan/Components/LearningCore/Source/gov/sandia/cognition/learning/algorithm/clustering/SNNClusterer.java
